# Diabetes_Diesease_Prediction
Key Features:

Input Features: The model takes into account a range of input features such as age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, insulin levels, glucose concentration, and more. These features are known to influence diabetes risk and are used to build a predictive relationship.

Linear Regression Algorithm: Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique that establishes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable. The model calculates the best-fit line that represents the relationship between the features and the probability of diabetes occurrence.

Feature Scaling: Before training, the model preprocesses the data by scaling features to ensure that they are on a similar scale. This helps prevent certain features from dominating the prediction solely due to their larger magnitude.

Training and Learning: The model undergoes a training phase where it learns the coefficients for each feature in the linear equation. It aims to minimize the difference between the predicted diabetes probabilities and the actual outcomes present in the training dataset.

Evaluation Metrics: The accuracy of the model is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help measure how well the model performs in terms of correctly predicting positive and negative cases of diabetes.
